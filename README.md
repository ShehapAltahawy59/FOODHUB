   FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
   ```

2. Ensure that your Firebase credentials file is not tracked by Git by adding it to `.gitignore`:
   ```
   firebase_config.json
   ```

### Setting Environment Variables

- On Linux/macOS, run:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/firebase_config.json"

     ```bash
     firebase login
     ```
   - Initialize Firebase in your project:
     ```bash
     firebase init
     ```
     Follow the prompts to set up hosting, Firestore, and authentication.

3. **Deploy to Firebase**:
